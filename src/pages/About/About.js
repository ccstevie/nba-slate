      <p>
        I'm just a normal guy who has watched and played a ton of sports and have had success betting over the past year.
        I aim to provide enough explanation and reasoning so that it can aid your own judgement on what picks you decide to tail.
      </p>
      <p>
        For reference, my unit sizes are $10 and I am up around 152u and 94u on Bet365 and DraftKings solely this month.
        I use Fanduel, BetMGM and occassionally PointsBet as well, however they don't provide monthly reports.
      </p>
